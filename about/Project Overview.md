## Projects Overview


### Computer Vision Project:

#### Abstract:

Automatic image colorization is a significant challenge in computer vision, with existing methods based on CNNs and GANs often suffering from desaturation and instability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage framework that enhances the pre-trained SIGGRAPH17 model with an advanced refinement module. Our core contribution is an Enhanced U-Net that uniquely integrates a diffusion-inspired single-step residual correction mechanism, a global color prior vector to ensure color coherence, and a self-attention block in the decoder to capture fine-grained details. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves a state-of-the-art Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 63.812, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.500, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.983, marking a 19.03\% MSE reduction compared to the powerful SIGGRAPH17 baseline. Our approach yields more vivid and semantically consistent colorizations, providing an effective solution for high-quality automatic image colorization.

Soul Symphony is a 2D rhythm-platformer game where players compose music to shape the world around them, developed by elm. By creating melodies, they can manipulate platforms and objects, rescue lost souls, and uncover a story of faith and sacrifice. The game combines rhythm, creativity, and narrative to deliver an immersive and emotional experience.

**2. Mobius**
