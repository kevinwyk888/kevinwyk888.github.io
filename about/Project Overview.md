## Projects Overview

### Computer Vision Project:

#### Abstract:

Automatic image colorization is a significant challenge in computer vision, with existing methods based on CNNs and GANs often suffering from desaturation and instability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage framework that enhances the pre-trained SIGGRAPH17 model with an advanced refinement module. Our core contribution is an Enhanced U-Net that uniquely integrates a diffusion-inspired single-step residual correction mechanism, a global color prior vector to ensure color coherence, and a self-attention block in the decoder to capture fine-grained details. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves a state-of-the-art Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 63.812, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.500, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.983, marking a 19.03% MSE reduction compared to the powerful SIGGRAPH17 baseline. Our approach yields more vivid and semantically consistent colorizations, providing an effective solution for high-quality automatic image colorization.

### Probabilistic Methods in Engineering Project

### Abstract

Fatal police shootings in the United States have long been a critical issue, raising concerns about social security and trust. This project analyzes the patterns of fatal police shootings in the US from 2015 to 2025. We use software like \textit{Mathematica} to visualize the data according to different classifications, apply the methods of hypothesis testing to test the Poisson distribution and weekdays' or months' independence, calculate the confidence intervals for parameters, and predict intervals for the number of observations. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the difference in black victimization rates between democratic and republican states, and other external factors' influence represented by body camera's carrying.

Our analysis reveals that the daily frequency of fatal police shootings follows a Poisson distribution with a maximum-likelihood estimated parameter of 2.85464. A goodness-of-fit test supports this assumption, but the COVID-19 pandemic influences the distribution. The multinomial statistics indicate that variations in shooting frequencies on weekdays and months are not a random chance, but they are dependent. Further analysis displays the statistical significance of a higher proportion of black victims in democratic states than in republican states, and the proportion of black victims in incidents involving body cameras is statistically significantly higher than in unrecorded incidents.

This study provides valuable insights into the patterns and influencing factors of fatal police shootings, and also serves as a good practice for various statistical analysis methods.

Soul Symphony is a 2D rhythm-platformer game where players compose music to shape the world around them, developed by elm. By creating melodies, they can manipulate platforms and objects, rescue lost souls, and uncover a story of faith and sacrifice. The game combines rhythm, creativity, and narrative to deliver an immersive and emotional experience.

**2. Mobius**

A 2-D classic platform collision game.

### 2024 MCM/ICM

### Abstract

This project develops a comprehensive decision-making framework to support insurers, property developers, and community leaders facing increasing risks from climate-driven extreme-weather events. Using more than three decades of disaster and economic data, we construct an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to quantify regional insurance payout risk and define a profitability index for underwriting decisions. We further employ ARIMA time-series forecasting—optimized through exhaustive parameter search—to predict future profitability trends and evaluate regional sustainability for insurance providers. For property developers, we extend the model by redefining risk variables and weighting schemes, enabling long-term assessment of development feasibility across U.S. states. Finally, we design a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) preservation model to evaluate the cultural and economic value of historically significant buildings, achieving 94.7% accuracy. Together, these models offer a unified analytical pipeline for underwriting decisions, development planning, and cultural heritage preservation under worsening climate conditions.
